# 2-Player-Tetris

To play the game, open the Tetris.py and execute it. 
This project is made for practicing pygame library in Python. The structure of code is again complicated and not easy to read because lack of comment lines like the previous 2-player chess game, but I tried to create the variable names properly to make it a little easier to understand the code. Nevertheless, I know it is still hard to read. 
In the game there is not an entry page. The game starts immediately when the code is executed. Controls are arrow keys for one player and "w,a,s,d" for the other player. w and up arrow key are used to rotate, s and down arrow key are used to land faster and a,d, right arrow key and left arrow key are used to move left and right. The game is very similar to classical tetris. Differences are score system, accelerating speed and some new tetris blocks. You get points when you place a block and fulfill a line. Fulfilling the lines at the same time results in bonus scores. For example, in the game filling 5 line is possible, and if you do that you get th maximum bonus score. Sometimes rotating may not be work, it is not a bug. It can be happen if you try to rotate the block next to the borders to prevent the blocks to move beyond the borders.
